Creating campaigns involves picking a name, creating a description, and defining the segments to associate with the campaign. These campaigns can then be assigned a category and defined publishing information.

Most marketers think of campaigns as being ways to communicate with their contact list. Campaigns can also be useful for lead management, marketing operations, and sales enablement.
