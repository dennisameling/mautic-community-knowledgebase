Creating campaigns involves picking a name, creating a description, and defining the segments to associate with the campaign. These campaigns can then be assigned a category and defined publishing information.

## Why use a campaign

* Most marketers think of campaigns as being ways to communicate with their contact list. Campaigns can also be useful for lead management, marketing operations, and sales enablement. 
* This might be the most powerful thing about Mautic. It lets you create a campaign or workflow incorporating multiple decisions, behaviour triggers and actions.
* These are displayed clearly so that almost anyone could look at it an immediately understand what is going on.
* There’s a drag and drop function which you use to build your conditions, actions, decisions and you name them yourself, so you’re always able to recognise what is happening or about to. It’s best to label these as literally as you can, to avoid any confusion later.
* You build a comprehensive flow and deliver relevant content to your potential customer based on their own behaviours.
